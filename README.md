<h1 align="center"> GreenVenture </h1> <br>

<p>
GreenVenture is an innovative mobile application that incentivizes users to recycle non-contaminated materials by providing rewards for their efforts. Inspired by the successful Healthy 365 app from the Health Promotion Board (HPB), GreenVenture takes a similar approach, allowing users to scan a QR code to earn points for recycling. This not only motivates users to take action towards a more sustainable future but also provides instant feedback on whether their item is a valid recyclable. By making recycling a more rewarding and engaging experience, GreenVenture aims to encourage a wider community to participate in environmental efforts and make a positive impact on the planet.
