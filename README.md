<p>
Inspired by the Healthy 365 app launched by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), GreenVenture is an application that rewards users for recyling a non-contaminated recyclable. Like the Healthy 365 app where users are allowed to scan a QRCode to gain points after purchasing a healthier choice product, this approach towards recycling not only incentives users to come ahead to recycle, but also provide instant feedback to users on whether their item is valid recyclable.
